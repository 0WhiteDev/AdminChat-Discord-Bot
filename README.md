# AdminChat Discord-Bot ðŸ¤–


Ticket bot for your discord server that you can chat with in private chat ðŸ’¬

## Basic information

The bot is built on the basis of JDA libraries and JDA supporting libraries ðŸ“š

#### Required
- Java 17+
- Discord bot token

#### How to Run Bot
- Create your app and bot on **https://discord.com/developers/applications/**
- Remember to check everything in the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section
- Generate a bot token and copy it
- Go to Main.java and paste it here
```
static String TOKEN = "TOKEN BOT HERE";
```
- And then run your project, the bot should turn on!

#### Overview of Bot
The bot is in my opinion a better version of the **ticket-bot**, the person who needs help creates a ticket and chats with the bot in **private messages**, and the administrator writes back on a special channel for this, thanks to this solution **no one will disturb you**, remember that you must set the id of the category that is **only available to administration**. You can close or delete a ticket at any time. Each person can only create 1 ticket so **no one will spam your server with tickets** (after closing a ticket you can create a new ticket again). ðŸ˜‹

#### Overview of Bot Commands
- **/author** - Check Bot Author and his SocialMedia
- **/set-category** - Set the categories in which tickets are to be created (You must do this for the bot to work properly)
- **/tickets** - Create a ticket creator on the chosen channel
